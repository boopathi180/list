                <li>Background</li><p>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century England. 
                    It became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th
                     and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket
                      matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport</p>
                      <li>Foundation</li><p>The "Cricket Foundation" is a term that can refer to a few different organizations.
                         One is the charitable arm of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) focused on grassroots and youth cricket,
                          which later became Chance to Shine. Another is the McGrath Foundation, an Australian breast cancer support
                           and education charity founded by Glenn and Jane McGrath. Additionally, there's the Cricket Live Foundation</p>
                           <li>Expansions and termination</li><p>Cricket has seen numerous expansions and terminations of tournaments,
                             teams, and rules throughout its history. 
                             Key examples include the expansion of the T20 World Cup to 20 teams in 2024,
                              the evolution of fielding restrictions in One Day Internationals (ODIs), and the introduction
                               and subsequent revision of the "handled the ball" dismissal law</p>

                <li>Tournament format</li><p>Cricket tournament formats vary, but commonly include group stages
                     followed by knockout rounds (semi-finals and finals), or single-elimination (knockout) brackets.
                      Some tournaments, like the Cricket World Cup, have a round-robin group stage where  each team plays every other team in their group.</p>
 <li>Player acquisition,suad composition and salaries</li><p>In professional cricket, 
  player acquisition, squad composition, and salaries are governed by specific rules
 and mechanisms, often detailed in league regulations or
  team-specific policies. Player acquisition typically involves auctions or player drafts where
 teams bid for players, considering factors like talent, experience, and market value.
 Squad composition refers to the strategic selection of players to form a balanced and 
 competitive team, taking into account roles, skills, and team dynamics. Salaries are determined
  through negotiations, often within a defined salary cap system, which limits the total amount teams
 can spend on player wages. </p>
<li>Match rules</li><p>In cricket, match rules vary based on the format (Test, ODI, T20, etc.),
but generally involve two teams of eleven players, with the objective of scoring more
 runs than the opposing team. </p>
<li>Prize money</li><p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket
 league in India, organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007,
 it features ten city-based franchise teams </p>

            <li>Defunct teams</li><p>Several cricket teams, both at the domestic and international level, have become defunct over time. These teams may have ceased to exist due to various reasons, including mergers, disbandment, or changes in the structure of cricket leagues. </p>
            <li>Timeline</li><P>Cricket has a long history, starting in England in the 16th century and becoming the national sport in the 18th century.
